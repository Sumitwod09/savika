        heroIntro: 'Buy authentic Kashmiri Mirch whole online in India — hand-picked from the sunlit valleys of Kashmir. Celebrated for its signature deep crimson colour and gentle warmth, Kashmiri Mirch is the secret behind restaurant-quality biryanis, rogan josh, and tandoori marinades. Unlike ordinary red chilli, it delivers vivid colour with very mild heat, making it perfect for family cooking. 100% natural, chemical-free, and FSSAI certified. Savika sources directly from verified Kashmir farms to bring you fresh, unadulterated spice in every pack.',
        whatIsThis: 'Kashmiri Mirch (Capsicum annuum var. Kashmiriense) is a bright red chilli variety indigenous to the Kashmir valley of northern India. Grown at altitudes between 1,500–2,500 metres, the cool mountain climate and rich volcanic soil give these chilies their characteristic thick skin, deep red pigmentation, and naturally sweet, mildly pungent flavour profile — scoring just 1,000–2,000 on the Scoville scale compared to 30,000–50,000 for regular red chilli.\n\nFor centuries, Kashmiri cuisine has relied entirely on this single variety to achieve the hallmark rich red colour of dishes like Rogan Josh, Dum Aloo, and Kashmiri Pulao without making them too spicy. Mughal court kitchens historically prized Kashmiri red chilli above all others for its aesthetic appeal. Today it remains a GI-tagged product from the Kashmir Valley, meaning authentic Deggi Mirch can only originate from this region.\n\nWhole Kashmiri Mirch is preferred over powder by discerning cooks because the full pod retains its essential oils, colour pigments (primarily capsanthin), and aroma compounds far longer than pre-ground powder. When you bloom whole Kashmiri chilies in hot oil, you extract a gorgeous crimson colour and a sweet warmth that powder simply cannot replicate.',

        storageInstructions: 'Store in an airtight glass jar or zip-lock bag, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Refrigeration is not required but extends colour intensity.

        sourcingStory: 'Savika\'s Kashmiri Mirch is sourced directly from small-batch farmers in the Pulwama and Baramulla districts of Kashmir Valley — the same micro-regions that have produced India\'s finest Deggi Mirch for generations. Our sourcing partner visits farms personally during harvest (October–November) to select only Grade A pods that meet our colour, aroma, and moisture standards. No middlemen. No blending with cheaper chilli varieties. The chilies are sun-dried for 3–4 weeks on elevated bamboo racks to preserve their natural oils, then cold-packed without any artificial colour or preservatives.',
        faqs: [
            { q: 'What is the difference between Kashmiri Mirch and regular red chilli?', a: 'Kashmiri Mirch is much milder (1,000–2,000 Scoville units vs 30,000–50,000 for regular red chilli) and has a significantly deeper red colour due to high capsanthin content. It\'s chosen for colour, not heat.' },
            { q: 'Is Kashmiri Mirch the same as Deggi Mirch?', a: 'Deggi Mirch is technically a blend of Kashmiri red chilli and other mild red chillies. Pure Kashmiri Mirch whole refers specifically to the GI-tagged Kashmiri variety. Our Savika product is 100% pure Kashmiri Mirch without blending.' },
            { q: 'Can I use Kashmiri Mirch powder instead of whole?', a: 'Yes, but whole Kashmiri Mirch retains its colour pigments and essential oils much longer than powder. For best results, use whole when doing a tadka or oil-based cooking step, and grind freshly when you need powder.' },
            { q: 'Is this product FSSAI certified?', a: 'Yes. All Savika spices are FSSAI registered and tested for pesticide residues, moisture content, and adulteration before packaging.' },
            { q: 'How much Kashmiri Mirch should I use per serving?', a: 'For a curry serving 4 people, 2–4 whole chilies suffice for rich colour. Adjust to taste — adding more increases colour without dramatically increasing heat.' },
            { q: 'Do you deliver pan-India?', a: 'Yes. Savika delivers across all states in India within 3–7 business days. Orders above ₹599 include free shipping.' },

        heroIntro: 'Buy premium turmeric powder online in India from Savika — freshly ground from high-curcumin Lakadong turmeric sourced directly from Meghalaya. With a curcumin content of 7–9% (vs 2–3% in ordinary supermarket turmeric), this is India\'s most potent, vibrant turmeric for cooking, wellness, and skin care. FSSAI certified. No artificial colour. Zero adulteration. Delivered fresh across India.',
        whatIsThis: 'Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is the golden root that has been the cornerstone of Indian cooking, Ayurvedic medicine, and religious ritual for over 4,000 years. Belonging to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), turmeric is a rhizome — an underground stem — that is harvested, dried, and ground into the vivid yellow-orange powder we know as haldi.\n\nIndia produces over 75% of the world\'s turmeric, with major cultivation in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and the northeastern state of Meghalaya. Lakadong turmeric from Meghalaya is considered the gold standard — it consistently tests at 7–9% curcumin content, the active compound responsible for turmeric\'s colour, flavour, and health benefits. Most commercial turmeric contains only 2–3% curcumin.\n\nNo Indian kitchen is complete without turmeric. It appears in virtually every curry, dal, rice dish, and marinade. Beyond cooking, turmeric has been used in Ayurveda for thousands of years as an anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and immunity booster. Modern science has validated much of this traditional wisdom — curcumin is now one of the most studied natural compounds in biomedical research.',

            { q: 'Is this organic turmeric?', a: 'Our Lakadong source uses traditional farming methods without synthetic pesticides. While not formally certified organic due to certification costs for small tribal farmers, we test every batch for pesticide residues.' },
            { q: 'How should I maximize curcumin absorption?', a: 'Curcumin has poor bioavailability on its own. Combine with black pepper (piperine increases absorption by 2,000%) and consume with healthy fats (ghee, coconut oil) for maximum benefit.' },
            { q: 'Can I use turmeric on my skin?', a: 'Yes. Mix with chickpea flour, milk/rose water, and a few drops of oil for a traditional ubtan face pack. Note: it will temporarily stain skin yellow — use at night or wash off within 15 minutes.' },

        heroIntro: 'Buy Savika Artisan Garam Masala online in India — a hand-blended small-batch spice mix crafted from 14 whole spices, stone-ground in our facility. Unlike factory garam masala blended from pre-ground powders, ours uses whole roasted spices ground to order, preserving the essential oils that make the difference between a good curry and an extraordinary one. No fillers. No salt. No MSG. Just pure, layered warmth.',
        whatIsThis: 'Garam Masala (literally "hot spice blend" in Hindi) is arguably India\'s most important spice blend and one of the most complex in world cuisine. Unlike a single-origin spice, it is a carefully balanced composition of multiple aromatic spices that together create a warmth, depth, and complexity no single spice can achieve alone.\n\nHistorically, every region and household in India has its own garam masala recipe passed down through generations. North Indian garam masala typically includes cinnamon, black cardamom, and cloves as dominant notes. South Indian versions lean toward pepper and fennel. Mughlai garam masala is more aromatic with mace, nutmeg, and star anise. Savika\'s Artisan Garam Masala follows a Northern recipe refined over 40 iterations to achieve what our culinary team describes as "the perfect balance of sweet warmth and earthy depth."\n\nQuality garam masala is only as good as its individual components. Pre-ground component powders lose 60–80% of their aromatic oils within 3–6 months. Our process starts with whole roasted spices sourced from their optimal growing regions — Malabar pepper from Kerala, black cardamom from Sikkim, cinnamon from Sri Lanka — each selected, dry-roasted separately at the optimal temperature, then blended and stone-ground together in small batches.',
